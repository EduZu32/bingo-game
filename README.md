# 🎱 Bingo Game (Java Project)

This is a console-based Java application that simulates a full Bingo game.  
The project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, with clearly separated classes to manage the game logic, Bingo card generation, and number drawing.

It was built as a personal learning project to practice Java programming and OOP design.
